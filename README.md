        Changes:
        
There are some changes from the presentation of the app at the beginning, I changed the design to make it look better.
I add the chat, which in my opinion is much better.

        Problems:
        
1.The phone that i used have many problem, for example the exact location of the phone some times work and some times does not 
(you can notice from the videos).

2.The phone has a reflections of the apps in the background all the time (you can notice from the videos).
