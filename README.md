        Changes:
        
There are some changes from the presentation of the app at the beginning, I changed the design to make it look better.
I add the chat, which in my opinion is much better.

        Problems:
        
1.The phone that i used have many problem, for example the exact location of the phone some times work and some times does not 
(you can notice from the videos).

2.The phone has a reflections of the apps in the background all the time (you can notice from the videos).

3.I kept my callBack class and function, but it does not work in my phone, i had the same problem at HW2 with the game and the sensor.

4.For some reason i could not put the Authentication in a separated class, it just wont work, so i just kept it like that.
